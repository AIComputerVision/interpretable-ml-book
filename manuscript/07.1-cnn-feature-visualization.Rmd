## CNN Feature Visualization

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known to "learn" features in it's layers.
Starting from edge detectors to detectors for faces.
This chapter explains how we can interpret what each neuron learned to detect.
Visualizing the images that maximize a neuron activation are called "Feature Visualization", because 

Convolutional Neural Networks have an architecture where first convolutional and pooling layers are connected, then fully connected layers.
The inputs are pixels.
While an image can be understood by a human, each single pixel does not hold much meaning.
By passing the pixels through the layers, the trained neural networks neurons get activated, based on the content of the picture.
The idea ...
